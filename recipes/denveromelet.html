  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>The Denver omelet is a change of pace from a French omelet and is known for its firmer texture and caramelized flavor. It's one of the first foods I learned to cook professionally as a line cook in high school. Make it a complete lunch or dinner with arugula salad and toasted bread.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    <li>¼ cup diced smoked ham</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons diced onion</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons diced green bell pepper</li>
    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>⅓ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Directions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>Beat eggs in a small bowl until just combined; do not overbeat.</li>
    <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add ham, onion, and bell pepper; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until onions soften and ham begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in eggs. Mix briefly with a spatula while shaking the pan to ensure ingredients are evenly distributed.</li>
    <li>Quickly run the spatula along edges of omelet.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle Cheddar cheese and cayenne pepper over omelet.</li>
    <li>Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until top is still wet but not runny, about 5 minutes. Use a spatula to fold omelet in half and transfer it to a plate.</li>
  </ul>
